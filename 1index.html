    <h2><i>Flowers</i></h2>
    <p>
      We were good, we were gold Kinda dream that can't be sold We were right
      'til we weren't Built a home and watched it burn
      <br />
      Mm, I didn't wanna leave you I didn't wanna lie Started to cry, but then
      remembered
      <br />
      I can buy myself flowers Write my name in the sand Talk to myself for
      hours Say things you don't understand I can take myself dancing And I can
      hold my own hand Yeah, I can love me better than you can
      <br />
      Can love me better I can love me better, baby Can love me better I can
      love me better, baby
      <br />
      Paint my nails cherry red Match the roses that you left No remorse, no
      regret I forgive every word you said
      <br />
